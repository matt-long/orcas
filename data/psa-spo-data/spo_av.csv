% Aspirated and Non-aspirated sample mean flask results for Station SPO
%
% Column 1 is the sample date in YYYY-MM-DD format. 
%
% Column 2 is the sample time in HH:MM format. 
%
% Column 3 is the date in decimal format. 
%
% Column 4 is a flag for identifying uncertainty in the reported sampling time.
%   All sampling date/times are nominally corrected to UTC. But in some cases
%   the relevant correction is uncertain due to incomplete information on the
%   original sample log sheets. In this case Column 8 gives the (assumed)
%   correction applied (in hours). The flag is otherwise set to "UTC" indicating
%   that the time is not uncertain.
%
% Column 5 is a 3-letter station identifier.
%
%
% Licor:  CO2 concentration (ppm) as measured on Licor; corrected for
%     non-linearity and primary drift
% N:   - Number of flasks retained in the average
% SD: Standard deviation of retained points in reported average
%
% Siemens: CO2 concentration (ppm) as measured on Siemens; corrected for
%     non-linearity and primary drift
% N:   - Number of flasks retained in the average
% SD: Standard deviation of retained points in reported average
%
% 44/28: CO2 concentration (ppm) as calculated from reduced ratio 40/28
%     on ISOPRIME; corrected for primary drift and interferences
% N:   - Number of flasks retained in the average
% SD: Standard deviation of retained points in reported average
%
% Interf:  delta O2/N2 from interferometer; corrected for CO2 interference
%     and primary drift
% N:   - Number of flasks retained in the average
% SD: Standard deviation of retained points in reported average
%
% 32/28; delta 32/28 (per meg) on ISOPRIME; corrected for primary drift
%     and interferences
% N:   - Number of flasks retained in the average
% SD: Standard deviation of retained points in reported average
%
% 40/28: delta  40/28 (per meg) on ISOPRIME; corrected for primary drift
%     and interferences
% N:   - Number of flasks retained in the average
% SD: Standard deviation of retained points in reported average
%
% APO: Atmospheric potential oxygen calculated from Siemens CO2 and Interferometer O2 as
%        APO =O2 + (1.1/0.20946)*(CO2-350) 
% N:   - Number of flasks retained in the average
% SD: Standard deviation of retained points in reported average
%
%
% Flasks with other flag values >0 have been rejected from sample mean for other reasons.
